Hello! My name is Jason Jolly, a graduate from CodingDojo bootcamp
And a single father of one. I currently live in Southern California,
In Ventura County. 

As a new full stack developer I'm looking to
Learn more , gain experience and hopefully soon - a job.
So far through my bootcamp I've done Python, Java and Mern full stacks
As well as JavaScript, HTML, CSS , JQuery, BootStrap and more.

I have recently taught myself some typescript through codecademy and now
Am going into learning more about Cloud computing.
Specifically Microsoft Azure and AWS. Thanks for stopping by and
I hope I can learn from you & eventually you from me.

I'm open to any open source projects or any kind of help I can bring
To any fellow coder!
